# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2021) Solutions

As you'll figure if you take a long at my "blog", work is keeping me extremely busy,
so I'll probably take the lazy road this year. Also, since I'm now officially a Python
engineer, I'll use this opportunity to practice more Python in prioritym although I'll
try to refresh my skills occasionally.

As usual, wish me luck!
