# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2021) Solutions

As you'll figure if you take a look at my "blog", work is keeping me extremely busy,
so I'll probably take the lazy road this year. Also, since I'm now officially a Python
engineer, I'll use this opportunity to practice more Python in priority, although I'll
try to refresh my skills occasionally.

As usual, wish me luck!

UPDATE: Done! I only had time to do one day not in Python, and that was Java...
Seems like AdventOfCode is too time-consuming for me these days, but I'll do it for
as long as I can. Maybe I should commit to one language and make a utils packages.
We'll see in 2023 :)
